  `It’s only after we’ve lost everything that we’re free to do anything.`,
  `It is not our abilities that show what we truly are… it is our choices.`,
  `Oh yes, the past can hurt. But you can either run from it, or learn from it.`,
  `Do, or do not. There is no “try”`,
  `Life moves pretty fast. If you don’t stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.`,
  `I believe whatever doesn’t kill you, simply makes you…stranger.`,
  `The truth is a matter of circumstances, it’s not all things to all people all the time.`,
  `When I despair, I remember that all through history the way of truth and love has always won. There have been tyrants and murderers, and for a time, they can seem invincible, but in the end, they always fall. Think of it, always.`,
  `My momma always said, “Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you’re gonna get.`

  `Discerning travellers and Wes Anderson fans will luxuriate in the glorious Mittel-European kitsch of one of the director's funniest and most exquisitely designed movies in years.`,
  `Anderson's films are too precious for some, but for those of us willing to lose ourselves in them, they're a delight. "The Grand Budapest Hotel" is no different, except that he has added a hint of gravitas to the mix, improving the recipe.`,
  `I didn't find it amusing, and while I can appreciate the creativity, it's an hour and 40 minutes I wish I could take back.`,
  `The mannered, madcap proceedings are often delightful, occasionally silly, and here and there, gruesome and/or heartbreaking.`,
  `It is certainly a magical and childlike way of storytelling, even if the content is a little more adult.`,
